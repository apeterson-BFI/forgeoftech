Xianxia / Cyberpunk fusion (with real programming languages and realistic software tools and possible equipment)

[Brainstorming:]

Li Suyin's a more spiritually focussed cultivator, and her father is in the Imperial bureaucracy. Imagine instead that much of the bureaucracy was programmers, and that programmer / hacker is parallel to the spiritual / physical divide.

Li Suyin would be exploring the hacker side of things for the first time, with some level of familiarity of progamming.

Augmentation - layering cybernetic enhancements onto body and mind.
Flow - through steady instictive hacking, cultivating the hacker's art.
Formations - firewalls, honeypots, anti-viruses,etc.
Production - programming & writing new software and tools, can be sold to other disciples and/or developed into an art used in family or licensed.
Gear Production - Making a hacker's equipment. The empire controls the most essential semiconductor production lines, which maintain the imperial grip over society.

Argent Peak Sect toolset - Python and an initial set of Argent Peak sect libraries available by pip. Argent Peak Sect augmentation toolkit, and hacking toolkit.
