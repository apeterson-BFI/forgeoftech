Elder Qui's class was in the main server building. They had to wait outside, because the doors were locked.

There was a great thrum of computation perceptible even from outside the building. Waves of steam and mirages of heat periodically surged past Li Suyin.

Finally Elder Qui walked up from behind them. He was not dressed professionally, but instead seemed to have a head full of bed hair, and baggy sweatpants, a drenched headband and some kind of home brewed beverage in a glass jar, which he carried in his right hand, while his left was carrying a massive duffel bag with ease.

"Follow me. I will find a spot for all of you. Don't even think about touching the servers or network equipment in here. We've got a mountain of bandwidth watching this place just to allow you in."

Qui put Li Suyin in the corner between a kvm unit and an industrial cooling unit. Just standing their her body was exposed alternatively too the server room's extreme heat and the blast of flowing chilly air from the AC unit.

There was a new student, wearing a featureless black robe, who was placed a few feet from here, in between two racks of network equipment. This server room was way more discombobulated than the imperial server farms father worked with.

There were rack-mounted servers and free-standing behemoths, just the air circulation diagrams for the room there were in must have been wild. Heat and cold didn't blend together but simply flew past each other.

He didn't just set them up with a location, but also placed a small laptop with a latch level, rugged black plastic frame and backlit clicky keys which made a distinctively mechanical noise when pressed.

"Log in with your Sect email account and password," Elder Qui said over the room's intercom. The students were spread out through the facility. With only Li Suyin, the new girl and another guy in the opposite corner in their room.

"Flow... You may wonder why we are here in the server facility. Why you are in an uncomfortable place with the raw wildness of these servers blasting you with their heat. Why? Flow. The thrum of actual functioning equipment instead of silly beginner stuff. Disks chattering, cooling howling, distractions and discomforts, but also the chance to lose yourself.

"Flow means you are no longer there, but only a deeper world remains. The specifics of gear and code become your organs. Instead of heart and lungs, you have hardware and software. Instead of swords and shields, you have instrusions and alerts, firewalls and traps. Instead of keys pressed, you have a drumbeat of the keyboard being played as a masterful instrument.

"You will flow as a snake slips through a net, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. In this came, since you're knowledge levels are low and widely varied, you are going to play a game. A networked game, of course, because yes. The game is called snake, played on your terminal. Launch the snake game by running sudo apt install asnake, which is short for argent snake."

She could instantly tell those who weren't familiar with the vim hjkl keys as they crashed into the snake game's wall. 
Li Suyin dodged another snake, and made nice rectangular spirals, but found herself penned in shortly. 
Trying to make a very quick turn, she crashed into her own wall in 13th place.
