Elder Qui's class was in the main server building. They had to wait outside, because the doors were locked.

There was a great thrum of computation perceptible even from outside the building. Waves of steam and mirages of heat periodically surged past Li Suyin.

Finally Elder Qui walked up from behind them. He was not dressed professionally, but instead seemed to have a head full of bed hair, and baggy sweatpants, a drenched headband and some kind of home brewed beverage in a glass jar, which he carried in his right hand, while his left was carrying a massive duffel bag with ease.

"Follow me. I will find a spot for all of you. Don't even think about touching the servers or network equipment in here. We've got a mountain of bandwidth watching this place just to allow you in."

Qui put Li Suyin in the corner between a kvm unit and an industrial cooling unit. Just standing their her body was exposed alternatively too the server room's extreme heat and the blast of flowing chilly air from the AC unit.

There was a new student, wearing a featureless black robe, who was placed a few feet from here, in between two racks of network equipment. This server room was way more discombobulated than the imperial server farms father worked with.

There were rack-mounted servers and free-standing behemoths, just the air circulation diagrams for the room there were in must have been wild. Heat and cold didn't blend together but simply flew past each other.

He didn't just set them up with a location, but also placed a small laptop with a latch level, rugged black plastic frame and backlit clicky keys which made a distinctively mechanical noise when pressed.

"Log in with your Sect email account and password," Elder Qui said over the room's intercom. The students were spread out through the facility. With only Li Suyin, the new girl and another guy in the opposite corner in their room.

"Flow... You may wonder why we are here in the server facility. Why you are in an uncomfortable place with the raw wildness of these servers blasting you with their heat. Why? Flow. The thrum of actual functioning equipment instead of silly beginner stuff. Disks chattering, cooling howling, distractions and discomforts, but also the chance to lose yourself.

"Flow means you are no longer there, but only a deeper world remains. The specifics of gear and code become your organs. Instead of heart and lungs, you have hardware and software. Instead of swords and shields, you have instrusions and alerts, firewalls and traps. Instead of keys pressed, you have a drumbeat of the keyboard being played as a masterful instrument.

"You will flow as a snake slips through a net, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. In this came, since you're knowledge levels are low and widely varied, you are going to play a game. A networked game, of course, because yes. The game is called snake, played on your terminal. Launch the snake game by running sudo apt install asnake, which is short for argent snake."

She could instantly tell those who weren't familiar with the vim hjkl keys as they crashed into the snake game's wall. 
Li Suyin dodged another snake, and made nice rectangular spirals, but found herself penned in shortly. 
Trying to make a very quick turn, she crashed into her own wall in 13th place.

"Start another game once you lose. Just keep going. Lose... yourself..."

Li Suyin thought it all seemed silly, but she kept up with it anyway. She lost a few more smaller games, as multiple games were going on at the same time. Finally she won one against 2 other players.

Slowly, inperceptibly, she started just becoming the snake game player, and not herself. She even hosted two games, and played several very long gnarly games with impeccable play. She could turn around in one square.

Elder Qui was changing the rules of the game. It was faster now. She didn't even notice after that first moment. Her will was a sharp blade Continuously executing fine cuts, deflecting attacks. She moved with precision, the keys an extension of her will. She made seemingly dangerous moves against her competitors to endanger them, and rarely self-destructed.

What time was it? How long was this class session supposed to go?

After a time unmarked by conscious thoughts, she heard the voice of the Elder ring out like a bell. "If you consider what Flow is, you have it not. If you consider what anything is, you have not flow. Flow is, when nothing remains but the object. The picture is perfected when the picture taker is no longer there. Knowing destroys doing. Doing the thing destroys being the thing. Thingness is destroyed by no-thing-ness.

"And with that nonsense that is indeed sensical, you are returning from flow. You may find yourself groggy, hungry, thirsty, panicked perhaps? Be stilled. I have prepared some food, so that you may take in my final remarks for the week."

Elder Qui's voice seemed to be omni-present. 

Li Suyin looked down from the laptop screen, rubbing her suddenly bleary eyes. She took the small dish of nachos resting on top of the server nearby.

"Some may wonder why hackers eat such horrible food. Remember that flow requires dedication, and an ability to lose track of time, sudden hunger, and a depleted body in need of abundant nutrients. As you develop in your hacker art, your dependence on such things as actual food, will lessen, but for your time in the outer sect, quick, available food of high intensity is critical."

She had never tasted true hacker foods before she came to the sect. Cheese was a luxury, even for a lesser bureaucrat like father. Cheesy nachos, handed out like a bowl of rice, that was something absurd.

She ate while listening to the Elder speak.

"Our class sessions will be variable in length. You will not know how long they will be, because knowing is counterproductive to flow. A few of you had problems entering the state of flow. A few of you were already trained in entering flow, and the majority of you had never entered flow, and just had your first experience of it. The first experience is always longer and more uncontrollable than latter experiences. It's now tuesday evening, and if you notice, this server facility has no windows. So no awareness nor concern could come over you at an inappropriate time.

We will return to the normal for Friday's session, for those who wish to continue. Some many wish to only get their first experience of flow through a guided experience, and then proceed independently. For some of you, that will be the best path. For many of you, I recommend fulfilling as much of the three months of instruction that you can qualify for. I will have a couple of 
qualification sessions to see who gets to continue one. They will  be sometime around 1 month and 2 months after today."

"Do not be concerned about your lack of control, I can get into a flow state for just five minutes, or I could close my doors and hack for a month. You will gain control, over time."

Li Suyin realized she had missed the first cybernetics class. Perhaps Su Ling now thought she was the one who was never there. She stumbled out of the server center, following the Elder's instructions. Like the other students, she was in need of sleep and a good wash.

She opted to sleep first.
